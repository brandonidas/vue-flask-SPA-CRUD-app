NOTE: this is repo is continually under construction, even if the recruiters don't get back to me. I think this is a good portfolio thing to have. Also, an image repository is a good platform to build many different things off of.

Dear Shopify Recruiters, given I have the sickness and an impending 3 interviews, I have left this project undone, though have applied for this round. Currently Photo uploads work. The following is the current state of the application:

STEPS:
1. DISABLE CORS : https://medium.com/swlh/avoiding-cors-errors-on-localhost-in-2020-5a656ed8cefa
2. The backend runs on flask, so cd into the server directory and run "python app.py"
3. The frontend runs on Vue, so cd into client and run "npm run server"
CAVEAT: I have not yet tested this on a fresh install and thus there maybe needed packages or other set up. And as every developer knows, set up is the worst part.
